# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection in Python

This project involves finding an efficient way to process real-time sequences of data by designing algorithms capable of detecting anomalies, concept drift, and seasonality. A simulated dataset was generated and processed by the Python script. Real-time plotting of the data allowed visualization of the algorithm's output. Simultaneously, a seasonality test was performed to extract the seasonality information from the series.

## How to Install

Use the following commands to install the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:astrozeneka/real-time-series-analysis.git
cd real-time-series-analysis
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the script, use:
```bash
python stream-analysis.py
```
